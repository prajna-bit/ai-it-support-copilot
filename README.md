- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed scoring with personalized learning recommendations  
- **Feedback Loop**: User feedback system with analytics dashboard for continuous AI improvement

## **Tech Stack**

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- TanStack Query for state management
- Wouter for routing

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express.js
- Python Flask (for AI/ML components)
- OpenAI API (GPT-4 & text-embedding-ada-002)
- PostgreSQL with Neon serverless

**AI/ML:**
